An alcohol detector sensor using Arduino Uno is a device that can detect the presence of alcohol in the air and provide an alert when the alcohol concentration exceeds a certain level. It is based on the use of a gas sensor that is capable of detecting alcohol vapors in the air.

To build an alcohol detector sensor using Arduino Uno, you will need the following components:
•	Arduino Uno board
•	MQ-3 alcohol sensor module
•	Breadboard
•	Jumper wires
•	LED
•	220-ohm resistor

The MQ-3 alcohol sensor module is a gas sensor that can detect the concentration of alcohol in the air. It works by detecting changes in electrical conductivity when alcohol vapors come into contact with its sensitive element. The Arduino Uno board is used to read the analog output of the MQ-3 alcohol sensor module and to control the LED.
